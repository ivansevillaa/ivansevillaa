I'm Ivan, a JavaScript developer from Argentina <img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/197/197573.svg" width="13"/>  
I am able to develop a product end to end. Although my specialty is working in the frontend with technologies like React, NextJS, CSS, etc.

### ðŸ§¡ My work
ðŸ”­ Below I'll show you some projects that I developed with the goal of demonstrate knowledge in each technology that I use.  

* An app that I developed with NextJS was [this](https://next-fruits.vercel.app/) and the code is [here](https://github.com/ivansevillaa/next-fruits).
* In my free time I'm working in a full stack project with tools like react, webpack, babel, nodejs, express, mongodb, etc. You can see my progress [here](https://github.com/ivansevillaa/Netflix-Clone ).
* I developed various projects with React, [this](https://github.com/ivansevillaa/Podcasts) is one, this is a podcast app.
* Also work in the backend with node and express, [here](https://github.com/ivansevillaa/Netflix-Clone-API) you can see a movie API that I developed. And in this project I've used Passport and JSON Web Tokens.
* I made this [simon game](https://ivansevillaa.github.io/Simon-Game) with vanilla js. The [code](https://github.com/ivansevillaa/Simon-Game).
* The best work that I made when I started on web development world using only html and css is [this](https://github.com/ivansevillaa/Brand-DigitalProduct). Look at the [code](https://github.com/ivansevillaa/Brand-DigitalProduct).
