# Hi there 👋

I like teaching so I created a blog to do it. You can take [a look here](https://oscarrier-ivansevillaa.vercel.app/):

<!-- 
I'm Ivan, a JavaScript developer from Argentina <img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/197/197573.svg" width="13"/>  
I am able to develop a product end to end. Although my specialty is working in the frontend with technologies like React, NextJS, CSS, etc.

### 🧡 My work
🔭 Below I'll show you some projects that I developed with the goal of demonstrate knowledge in each technology that I use.
