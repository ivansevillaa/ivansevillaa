I'm Ivan, a JavaScript developer from Argentina <img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/197/197573.svg" width="13"/>  
I am able to develop a product end to end. Although my specialty is working in the frontend with technologies like React, NextJS, CSS, etc.

### ğŸ§¡ My work
ğŸ”­ Below I'll show you some projects that I developed with the goal of demonstrate knowledge in each technology that I use.
